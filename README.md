# CrystalPlasticity

## Objectives
* modeling and description of plastic deformation and yielding in crystalline solids based on the dynamics of dislocations and slip avalanches at micro-structural scales
* Perform multi-scale simulations including coarse-grained lattice-based models such as discrete dislocation dynamics and/or molecular dynamics simulations in order to capture bulk yield properties
* Further analyze deformation and strain patterns by implementing efficient machine learning algorithms  and develop, train, and validate minimal predictive models that allow for predicting failure.
